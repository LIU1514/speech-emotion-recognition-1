This project is based on the open source tool ***openSmile*** [here](https://www.audeering.com/opensmile/). It aims to extract audio features from the speech, thus recognizing the emotion what the utterance embodies. In addition, this project is one of the projects of ***Ximalaya*** Â® 's Hackathon.

## Installation

### macOS

It is tricky to compile openSmile on macOS. Basically, you can refer to this [link](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_42120869/article/details/80837216).

### win

You can simply use the release version in **/bin/Win32** or you can compile it. The official guidance is on the webpage of ***openSmile***, **Installation and Documentation** part.

## Usage

The basic introduction of ***openSmile*** is [here](https://blog.csdn.net/lccever/article/details/78621892). 
For our specific project, you can use command tool to run this executable file like this:

```
SMILExtract_Release -C ./opensmile/opensmile-2.3.0/config/IS09_emotion.conf -I ./opensmile/audio/in/1.wav -O ./opensmile/audio/out/1.txt
```

The first argument **-C** should be followed by a config file that determines which features to extract. The config files are contained by the directory **/config** The second argument **-I** is the audio input while the last argument is the result.

Or you can directly use our ***feature_extraction.py*** to run this specific project.
